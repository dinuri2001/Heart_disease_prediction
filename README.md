 Heart Disease Risk Predictor

This project predicts the risk of heart disease using patient data. Built with Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit for the frontend.

📊 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with seaborn and matplotlib
- Trained with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost
- ROC curve and Confusion Matrix for model evaluation
- Streamlit app for easy prediction input
- Saved model using `joblib` for deployment

 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Streamlit
- Joblib

 🚀 How to Run the App Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dinuri2001/heart-disease-predictor.git
    cd heart-disease-predictor
    ```

2. Install dependencies (use a virtual environment if possible):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
